# AI Profile Matching Agent üß†‚ú®

This project implements an intelligent AI agent that matches user-defined queries with the most relevant professionals based on structured profile data and unstructured LinkedIn-style resumes.

It was developed as part of the **AI Agent Expert Matching Competition 2025**.

## üîç What it Does

The agent analyzes a user's query (e.g. *"Looking for a senior AI engineer with edge computing experience in Chicago"*) and scores the relevance of 40 mock professional profiles using a large language model (Gemini by Google).

It returns the **top-matching candidates**, including:
- Name and job title
- Location
- Contact info
- Availability
- Relevance score (0‚Äì10)
- AI-generated explanation of the match

## üß≠ Two Approaches Implemented

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Dynamic Prompting (LLM-only mode)**
- Sends the full query, Excel metadata, and HTML resume to Gemini
- Gemini handles all reasoning: skills, availability, location
- Best for open-ended, flexible matching

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Filtered + Prompting (Hybrid mode)**
- Applies dropdown filters (City, Job Title) to limit the candidate pool
- Sends each candidate‚Äôs structured + unstructured data to Gemini for scoring
- Balances precision and performance (quota-safe)
